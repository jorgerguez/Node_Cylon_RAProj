# Cylon.js For Raspberry Pi

Cylon.js (http://cylonjs.com) is a JavaScript framework for robotics and physical computing using Node.js

This module provides an adaptor for the Raspberry Pi single board computer (http://www.raspberrypi.org/).

  work: function(my) {
    every((1).second(), function() { my.led.toggle(); });
  }
});

// start working
robot.start();
```
